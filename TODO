Bug:
- When a player disconnects from the game resulting in a game with fewer than 3 players,
	data from the drawing canvas in the prompt drawing state is still saved (FIXED)

TODO
- Prevent game from generating duplicate prompts for two people
- Detect title guesses which are the same as other people
- Test if program functions correctly when timer reaches 0s
