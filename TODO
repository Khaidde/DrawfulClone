Bug:
- When a player disconnects from the game resulting in a game with fewer than 3 players,
	data from the drawing canvas in the prompt drawing state is still saved (FIXED)
- Certain brown colors are transparent (FIXED)
- Prevent game from generating duplicate prompts for two people (Potentially done? => Needs more testing)
- Leaving during the lobby as the first person in the list causes errors (Potentially fixed? => Needs more testing)
- Server hangs after each subsequent round and doesn't continue to the result state (Potentially fixed?)
- Weird stuff happens when people don't decide to guess a title (FIXED)
- Handle what happens when a client reloads the page with the same socket.id -> make them disappear or disconnect them (Potentially Fixed?)

TODO
- Detect title guesses which are the same as other people (DONE)
- Test if program functions correctly when timer reaches 0s

- Delete code which automatically sends images and answers to the server
